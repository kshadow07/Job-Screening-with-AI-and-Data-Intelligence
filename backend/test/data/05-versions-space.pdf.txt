Alright, so I need to help summarize this PDF into bullet points focusing on
key skills, experience, and education. Let me start by reading through the
content carefully.

First, there's a section about work experience. It says Kaushik is a freelance
software developer and AI engineer since January 2023. He's self-employed
and virtual. His projects include developing YouTube summarization tools
using APIs like Whisper, Gemini, and ChatGPT. He also built real-time apps
with WebSocket for audio/video processing. Additionally, he designed
backend solutions with Node.js and Firebase. He led the development of a
women's safety wearable device with real-time tracking and emergency alerts.
He also worked on IoT systems using ESP32.

Next is his education: a B.Tech from BIT Sindri starting in 2023. He has a
senior secondary diploma from St. Mary's English High School with a
percentage of 94%. Then there are training bootcamps like Google Data
Analytics, Coursera courses on Python, Flutter, and web development.

Looking at the skills listed: he knows Python, TypeScript, Dart, ReactJS,
Next.js, Flutter, Node.js, Express.js, Firebase, MongoDB, NLP, Pandas,
NumPy, Power BI, SQL, ESP32, IoT, Android, algorithms, PostgreSQL, and
Postman. 

Extracurricular activities include contributing to open-source projects and
participating in hackathons. He also won an award for a women's safety
device.

I need to condense all this into 3-5 bullet points each covering skills,
experience, education, training, and extracurriculars. I should make sure each
point is clear and concise, focusing on the most relevant aspects without
going too deep into each section.
